# Apple_Stock_Price_Prediction_LSTM
## Stock Price Prediction for Apple with LSTM
This project uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict the future price of Apple stock. The LSTM model is trained on a dataset of historical Apple stock prices and other relevant features, such as the price of other technology stocks and economic indicators.
Stock price prediction is a classic time series forecasting problem, and LSTM networks are well-suited for handling sequential data like stock prices.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains historical daily stock price data for Apple Inc. (AAPL). It includes the following columns:

* Date
* Open price
* High price
* Low price
* Close price
* Volume
- You can replace this dataset with your own stock price data if desired.
## Model Architecture
The neural network model used for stock price prediction consists of LSTM layers for sequence modeling, followed by fully connected (Dense) layers for regression. The model architecture is as follows:

* LSTM layer (128 units, return sequences=True)
* LSTM layer (64 units, return sequences=False)
* Dense layer (25 units)
* Dense output layer (1 unit)
## Results
The project results and performance metrics can be found in the Jupyter Notebook Apple_Stock_Price_Prediction.ipynb. The notebook includes visualizations of the predicted stock prices and evaluation metrics to assess the model's accuracy.
